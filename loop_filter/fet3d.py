"""
Generalization of Evenbly's full environment truncation (FET) in 3D.
- The original paper of Evenbly is explained in 2D, see
Title: Gauge fixing, canonical forms, and optimal truncations
in tensor networks with closed loops
Author: Glen Evenbly

- We generalize it to 3D, by approximating a cube
of 8 copies of 6-leg tensors.
All the relevant environments are construction in `./env3d.py`
